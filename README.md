# Movie-Recommendation-using-Python
Nowadays, the recommendation system has made getting the things effortlessly that we need. 
The main purpose of Movie recommendation systems is to help movie enthusiasts 
by suggesting what movie to watch without the hassle to have
to go through the time-consuming process of deciding from a

The proposed solution is for improving the scalability and
quality of the movie recommendation system. For computing
similarity between the different movies in the given dataset
efficiently and in least time and to reduce computation time
of the movie recommender engine we used cosine similarity
measure.
